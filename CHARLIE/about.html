            <p id="subtitleTwo">I was born on August, in 2015, in Subotica, Serbia. When I was a month old I moved to Novi Sad. I didn’t like the trip. Not at all. But the food is sooo much better and I met some nice folks here. I don’t remember all of their names. It is hard to remember someone’s name while concentrating on nibbling, and I do that almost all the time. When I’m not eating, I like to run on my red wheel and to sing, just to create the rhythm for running. People call that sound a chipping sound, but for me those are some serious workout songs. Last August I turned two years. I have pictures to prove it. You can see the cake with two birthday candles and me eating it. The cake. Not the candles! So, when I already mentioned photos, I have to say I’ve become a photo model and actor. Because I’m a natural, I’ve got a lot of great photos and videos in no time. Besides enjoying this pop star life, I also enjoy food. I love it! Walnut, hazelnut, peanut, fruit, cereal...But not the bugs. Ugh, that's gross! I would never eat that. One time an unknown bug ran into my home. I was curious and I chased her, or him, who would know what it was, but the bug ran away. That’s why I like food with no legs. Because it cannot escape! Sooo, those were fun facts about me. And one anecdote. If You want to see more of me You can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/charliethechip15/">follow me on Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVT39yaPAgyQk5zrxp5lhXA">subscribe and watch my funny videos on YouTube.</a> Enjoy!</p>
